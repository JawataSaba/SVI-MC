# SVI-MC
A probabilistic social vulnerability index
This study introduces SVI-MC, a probabilistic approach that leverages 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations to quantify aleatoric uncertainty in the SVI. 
Our method embeds sampling variability directly into index calculations, producing uncertainty aware composite vulnerability estimates.
Additionally, we introduce an entropy-based measure that complements coefficients of variation (CVs) by capturing instability in categorical rankings. 
The technical details of the methodology have been discussed in the PLoS One paper. 
SVI-MC provides a more comprehensive and uncertainty-aware approach to social vulnerability assessment. 
This method is scalable, replicable, and adaptable, offering future applications for larger study regions or at finer observation units. 
The raw data for variables can be downloaded from the American Community Survey (DATA.CENSUS.GOV)(https://data.census.gov/cedsci/). The SVI data are also directly downloadable 
from the Place and Health - Geospatial Research, Analysis, and Services Program (GRASP) (https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/place-health/php/svi/index.html).
